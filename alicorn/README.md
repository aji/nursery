# Alicorn

Alicorn is an unfinished IRC bouncer. Wait until I finish it...

# Support

The official Alicorn support channel is irc.staticbox.net #alicorn

# Building

Build with

    $ aclocal -I m4
    $ autoconf
    $ automake --foreign --add-missing
    [ignore automake's complaining]
    $ ./configure [config options as you wish]
    $ make

There is no installing yet.
