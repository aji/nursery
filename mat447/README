  This is Alex Iadicico's framework for examining the running time of
  prime factorization algorithms writen with PARI.

  This code was created for the MAT 447 Fall 2012 honors contract as
  part of a survey of a few simple integer factorization algorithms. This
  suite is designed to generate accurate data about the running time of
  these algorithms.

  The numbers being factored are of the form N = pq, where p and q are
  large primes of roughly the same size. These types of numbers are of
  special importance to the cryptography community. The RSA cryptosystem
  derives its security from the difficulty of factoring numbers of
  this type.
