# `cray` -- An unbiased renderer

This is not intended to be a practical product, but I'm flattered if you think
it is.

# Background nobody asked for

I've been fascinated with computer graphics for ages. Indeed, two of the first
programming projects I remember really drilling down into were a software
rasterizer and a Mandelbrot set explorer. However, in all this time, I've never
attempted a raytracer. Not even once. A Wolfenstein-style raycaster may have
slipped in there but that's a far cry from an unbiased raytracer.

Recently I've had a resurgence in interest in computer graphics. With a
stronger math background and more experience with programming in general, I
feel a simple unbiased raytracer is within my reach.
