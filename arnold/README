INTRODUCTION

  arnold is a shell script that takes care of configuring your
  ~/.minecraft directory. It currently only focuses on the mods/,
  coremods/ config/, and saves/ directory. It can also add jar mods,
  though for most sane setups this should only be forge and one or two
  other mods (optifine, zombe, etc.)
  

PROFILES

  arnold is built around "profiles." Profiles go in the "profiles" directory
  in the Minecraft directory, which will be ~/.minecraft/profiles for most
  people. A profile is a directory that contains a file called "profile"
  and optionally a config/ and saves/ directory. The "profile" file is
  really just a shell script that is sourced by arnold. arnold provides
  a few functions intended to be used in these profiles:
  
    {debug,info,warn,error} MESSAGE
        Prints a message
  
    die MESSAGE
        Prints a message and exits
  
    forgemod MOD
        Creates a symlink in ~/.minecraft/mods

    coremod MOD
        Creates a symlink in ~/.minecraft/coremods
  
    jarmod MOD
        Extracts the specified mod into minecraft.jar
  
    import PROFILE
        Sources the profile script from a different profile.
  
    useconfig PROFILE
        Use the config/ dir in the specified profile. By default, the
        config/ dir in the "default" profile is used.
  
    usesaves PROFILE
        Use the saves/ dir in the specified profile. By default, the saves/
        dir in the profile being launched is chosen.


WARNING

  I did a bad job explaining everything above. As explained in the
  license below, if you screw up your Minecraft installation, you only
  have yourself to blame. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you first read through
  the script itself. If you still have questions, then you may contact aji
  on EsperNet, but ONLY AFTER HAVING TRIED TO FIND THE ANSWER YOURSELF.
