DESCRIPTION

   testbox is a very simple testing framework that works by verifying
   a program's output when given certain inputs.

   To use testbox as a unit testing framework, it will be necessary to
   create a suite of driver programs that can test individual units of
   a program.


FILES

  testbox.py
     The main testbox program. Run with python testbox.py INPUT

  example-sh.json
     A file showing how testbox can be used to send input to the program
     on the command line and to use stdout as the criteria for pass
     or fail.

  example-grep.json
     An example of how testbox can send input to the program through
     both stdin and the command line, and how exit codes can be used as
     the criteria for pass or fail.

  example-match.json, match.c
     An example of what a real unit test might look like. match.c is a
     C source file that contains a wildcard matcher and simply returns
     the value of the match() function when called with the two command
     line arguments. The tests in example-match.json test a bunch of very
     basic wildcard matching cases, as well as a few "real-world" cases.
