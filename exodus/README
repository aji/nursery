                        still leaning toward exodus.

     exodus is a suite for inspecting Sega Genesis/Mega Drive ROMs. At
     its core is a basic instruction decoder, which is provided as a
     Python extension and command line program. On top of this is a GUI
     for interactively disassembling sections of a ROM.

     The use case is as follows: You just obtained a ROM image and you
     want to tweak it to perfection. You load up the ROM in exodus-gui
     where it is "disassembled" into many .word directives. You then
     interactively mark certain words for disassembly into 68000 assembly
     language. When you have determined the correct balance of code and
     data, you export a linker script, Makefile, and assembly source,
     make your tweaks, and feed them back into the GNU 68000 assembler
     and linker to rebuild the ROM.
