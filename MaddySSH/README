    This thing was created for a very particular purpose that I doubt
    anybody else really has trouble with. Use OpenSSH or something. I
    can guarantee that that's probably better than whatever Maddy's
    Secure Shell has to offer.

    Unless what you need is to compile on very old BSD systems that only
    implement the commonest of C functionality, then yes, MaddySSH is
    probably what you're looking for.
