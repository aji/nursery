                       THE P LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION
                               REVISION P1

                        (C) 2013 ALEX J IADICICCO



GOALS

  o  Lots of backwards compatibility with C. Projects with combined C
     and P source should be not only possible but encouraged, until P
     implementations are mature enough to compete with C.

  o  Redesign confusing concepts from C, such as pointers and signedness,
     to be less error prone and more beginner-friendly.

  o  Introduce new concepts that gloss over common design patterns in
     C. For example, opaque data and callback pairs can be replaced
     with closures.


THE TYPE SYSTEM

  P is a structurally, statically typed language.
