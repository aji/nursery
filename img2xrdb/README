A lot of people like to customize their .Xresources file and get all
sorts of pretty colors for their terminals.

I am one of those people.

I used to pick colors by creating a small 8x2 image in the GIMP, selecting
each pixel with the eye dropper, and manually copying the hex values
into my .Xresources file. Needless to say, this was very tedious work,
and made the process of picking colors very cumbersome. The focus became
the copying process and not the colors themselves.

So I wrote this script to take an image like the ones I had been creating
and turn it into a set of color values suitable for an .Xresources
file. It can also take a preamble and stick it on the top of the output
(if you don't want to do that with cat). Unfortunately, that's about
all it does right now.

It requires the Python Imaging Library. I've been trying to write Python
3 code, but my system only had PIL for Python 2. The script's shebang is
"#!/usr/bin/env python2" because the Python 2 installation on my system
is called "python2". Chances are yours is just "python", so if the OS
can't find a suitable interpreter, try changing this to just "python".

I've included the .png containing the colors I currently use in my
.Xresources as an example of how the colors are laid out in the image.

The script is less than 100 lines, so I'm not putting any sort of license
on it. Copy, modify, and distribute it as you wish. The same goes for all
the other files included in this project. They took me like 20 minutes,
so I don't really care enough. Of course, this also means that you're on
your own when it comes to errors and things. I'm assuming you're capable
enough to handle them yourself.
